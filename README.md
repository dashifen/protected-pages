# Protected Pages for WordPress

WordPress already has a sense of public and private pages. The former is what"s used to display the majority of sites which run WordPress.  The latter is shown only to those individuals that have user accounts for the site, are logged in, and have the capability to read private content.

But, what happens if you want to share private content with site members, but do not wish to create a user account for each of them on the site?  Enter the WordPress REST API and this plugin.

This plugin creates a Protected custom post type.  At the moment, that post type is not visible on the primary WordPress site, i.e. visiting the page for Protected content will result in a 404 error.  But, using the WordPress REST API, we can show Protected content on a specified site to group members without having to give them all user accounts for the site.
